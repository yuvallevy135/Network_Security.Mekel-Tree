Network Security - Merkle Tree
This is a code for a functional Merkle Tree.

In this project we:

Created a Merkle Tree.
Generated a Proof Of Inclusion to a given node in the tree.
Checked the validation of a given node, root, and Proof Of Inclusion.
Used "Brute Force" to find a valid hashed expression for a given difficult level.
Details
There are 4 different commands in this code, 1-4 as explained above. Examples: This command will create a new Merkle Tree with 4 members:

1 a b c d
The output is the root of the new tree:

12a40550c10c6339bf6f271445270e49b844d6c9e8abc36b9b642be532befe94
This command will generate a Proof Of Inclusion for the member in the 1st position (the count starts at 0):

2 1
The output will be the Proof of inclusion:

l a r 21e721c35a5823fdb452fa2f9f0a612c74fb952e06927489c6b27a43b817bed4
This command will check if the member b is a Merkle Tree with a root of 12a40550c10c6339bf6f271445270e49b844d6c9e8abc36b9b642be532befe94, and a Proof Of Inclusion of l a r 21e721c35a5823fdb452fa2f9f0a612c74fb952e06927489c6b27a43b817bed4 (The returned value is True/False):

3 b 12a40550c10c6339bf6f271445270e49b844d6c9e8abc36b9b642be532befe94 l a r 21e721c35a5823fdb452fa2f9f0a612c74fb952e06927489c6b27a43b817bed4
output:

True
This command will look for the first appearance of a hash with a given amount of zeros at the start of the hash. The hash will be built with i (an increasing number) and the root of the Merkle Tree appended to it. We iterate with i until we get a hash with the at least n leading zeors. The input :

4 2
will give us (at least 2 zeros at the start):

296 00038effdfc87247806ade69b932b51697490a9f9479ed43aef31657169e8703
296 is the number of iterations.
